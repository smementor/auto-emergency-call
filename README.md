a mobile app that triggers help automatically when user is in trouble

This is an ambitious project that allows user to send emergency help message, whenever and whereever they are in trouble. This app hopes to trigger all features of the moble device at that moment, with a single button. The button press will remove all locks on the device to send help message to public network. Examples include triggering sound, photos, location, video etc; so that help can arrive almost instanteneously.
